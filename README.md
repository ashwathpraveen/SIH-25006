## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management Portal designed to strengthen biosecurity practices in pig and poultry farms. The system enables farmers to digitally track farm operations, monitor animal health, regulate farm access, and detect early warning signs of diseases.
The portal will provide modules for visitor management, feed and waste tracking, vaccination reminders, geofencing alerts, and real-time health monitoring using IoT sensors.

This solution directly addresses the core problem of disease outbreaks caused by poor record-keeping, unrestricted farm access, and delayed detection. By automating biosecurity protocols, the portal ensures consistent monitoring and reduces human error. Its innovation lies in integrating IoT sensors, cloud-based dashboards, and automated risk alerts into a single platform tailored for livestock farms — a feature rarely seen in traditional agricultural tools.

## Technical ApproachThe portal will be built as a web-based and mobile-compatible application using:

Frontend: React/Angular, HTML5, CSS3

Backend: Node.js / Django

Database: MySQL / Firebase

IoT Integration: RFID tags, temperature/humidity sensors, ammonia/gas sensors

Cloud Hosting: AWS / Azure
Methodology

Data Collection Layer

Sensors collect environmental and health parameters.

RFID tags track animal movement.

Processing Layer

Backend applies risk-scoring algorithms.

Automated alerts generated for unusual activities.

User Interface Layer

Dashboard shows farm status, disease risks, and reports.

Mobile interface enables quick updates by farmers.

Prototype Flow (Summary)

Sensor → Cloud → Processing → Dashboard → Alerts/Reports
## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is highly feasible due to the availability of low-cost IoT sensors and cloud services. Adoption is viable because most farmers already use smartphones and are open to digital tools that reduce losses.

Potential Challenges

High initial setup cost for IoT devices

Limited digital literacy among rural farmers

Connectivity issues in remote areas

Mitigation Strategies

Offering a basic non-IoT version for small farms

Training workshops and multilingual UI

Offline-first mobile app with syncing when network becomes available

## Impact and Benefits
The portal can significantly improve biosecurity outcomes by ensuring consistent monitoring and early action.

Key Benefits

Social: Reduces disease spread, ensures safer meat production

Economic: Minimizes livestock mortality and financial losses

Environmental: Enables safer waste disposal and reduces chemical misuse

Operational: Automates logs, improves traceability, supports compliance with regulatory standards
